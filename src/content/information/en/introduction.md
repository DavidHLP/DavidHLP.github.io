Hi, I’m David, a passionate software engineer specializing in backend development and system architecture. I mainly work with **Java** and the **Spring** ecosystem to build high-performance, scalable enterprise applications. My expertise includes **microservices architecture, distributed system design, caching solutions (Redis, Spring Cache), and database optimization (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**. I value writing clean and elegant code while ensuring architectural stability and reliability. I believe that **“code is like poetry, architecture is like art”**, and I always follow a pragmatic approach by choosing the most suitable technology for each business scenario.

In the open-source space, I created **CacheGuard** — a high-performance caching framework built on Spring Cache and Redis. It addresses enterprise-level caching challenges with features such as intelligent TTL management, cache avalanche protection, flexible annotation-based extensions, and high-performance serialization. Through my blog, I share insights on technical explorations, practical experiences, and problem-solving approaches, aiming to help other developers avoid common pitfalls. If you’re interested in my articles or projects, feel free to connect with me on **GitHub [DavidHLP](https://github.com/DavidHLP)** or reach out via email — I’d be glad to exchange ideas and grow together.
